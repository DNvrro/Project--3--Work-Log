# Project--3--Work-Log
This repo utilizes a CSV file as a database to emulate a work log. The user is able to add new entries as well as search previous entries.
The user is able to search via the date of the task, the time spent, or an exact search.
Additionally the user is able to also use a regular expression search to comb through the CSV file and pick out the entries he/she may be looking for.
